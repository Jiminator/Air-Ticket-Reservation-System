MAJOR ISSUES:
	NO access control on any on the pages... customers can access all the staff
	pages and do things without loggin it !!!

	


EACH PAGE::::

Viewflights
	- Filtering by Source and Dest
		For my implementations, I made it a range but currently you are only
		allowing only one source and one destination.
	- the search by source gives you everything. Not sure if that is intended.
	- base price is incorrect


Addflight:
	- I dont think the query you wrote works. There are repeated flights
	- can add flights with airplane that is already departed and hasn't landed yet
		- I think it is because you are only checking for flightnum and not time

Updateflight status:
	- The error message is wrong if the user enters incorrect depart date

addPlane:
	- anyone can view the page
	- incorrect display message for wrong inputs
	- the plane ID will not be exact for large numbers.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEED TO CHECK THIS AS WELL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	(ENSURE THAT THE INPUT VALUES ARE WITHIN THE CORRECT BOUNDS FOR THE DATABASE COLUMNS)

addAirport:
	- access control! I can add an airport as a customer
	- key error

Viewflights:
	Broken Acess Control: staff from UA are able to see Jetblue flights....


frequent customers:
	Broken Acess Control: anyone can view the user profile.
	UA staff are able to view Jetblue customers!!!!

viewReports:
	I dont think the graph is correct
	Month sales and year sales dont match up

CompareRevenue:
	I think the query is wrong for this.
	I got month revenue = 130 but a year revenue of None.
